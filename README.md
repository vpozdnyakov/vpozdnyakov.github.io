### Research
*2022, Fault diagnosis methods for chemical processes, AIRI*\
We have trained transformer-based model using self-supervised learning and deep clustering. Our method outperforms existing approaches in unsupervised setting on chemical sensor data. TPR for fixed FPR 0.05 (SOTA/ours): 0.64/0.87.

*2021, Probabilistic forecasting using deep generative models, HSE & BCG Gamma*\
We have shown that existing deep probabilistic forecasting methods can be represented as a framework on the type of neural networks and the type of generative models. We have proposed forecasting approach based on GAN and TCN that shows promising results for future research.

*2021, Digital twins for production of superconductors, LAMBDA at HSE*\
We have designed a digital twin of the tool for producing superconductors based on deep probabilistic forecasting model DeepAR. It is used to find optimal operating modes and adjust parameters of production.
